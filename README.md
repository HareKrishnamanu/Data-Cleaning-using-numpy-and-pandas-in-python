Done some data cleaning and data processing using numpy and pandas in python for my Prepinsta's winter internship programme week 3. There are total of 2 projects in this week.

Here are the steps i took while working on the project:- 

1) Dataset Exploration:
Begin by exploring the provided dataset. Understand its structure, column names, and the types of data it contains.

Identify any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies within the dataset.

2) Library Setup:
Set up your Python environment with Pandas and Numpy. Ensure you have a Jupyter Notebook or another suitable platform for interactive coding.

3) Data Cleaning:
Address missing values by deciding on appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.

Handle any duplicate records in the dataset.

Correct any inconsistencies or errors in data entry.

4) Data Transformation:
Utilise Pandas and Numpy functions to transform the dataset according to the analysis requirements.

Consider creating new features, normalizing data, or handling categorical variables.

5) Handling Outliers:
Identify and address outliers in the dataset using the Numpy and Pandas methods.

Decide on an appropriate approach, whether itâ€™s removing outliers or transforming them.

6) Data Validation:
Validate the cleaned and transformed dataset to ensure that it aligns with the intended analysis goals.

Perform sanity checks on key variables and relationships within the data.

7) Documentation:
Document the steps you took to clean and manipulate the dataset, including the reasoning behind your decisions.
